# FlappyGrant
FlappyGrant is full of games that are high quality! Getting bored with the current selection? Email us!
You might be thinking: Why does FlappyGrant Studios have their website's backend AND frontend code public? Almost nobody does that! The answer: We want you to trust our website, unlike others which sell your data to companies for a profit. True, we could have a different GitHub for the real code, but there is more. Showing you the code can inspire others to make video game websites too! That's also why this respository has an MIT license.
